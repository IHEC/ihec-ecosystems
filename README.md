## Standards


### Metadata Specification

IHEC members and those who wish their metadata to participate in IHEC studies need to comply with certain metadata standards. Description of the standards are available here:

* [IHEC Metadata Specification (version 1.0)](https://github.com/IHEC/ihec-ecosystems/blob/master/docs/metadata/1.0/Ihec_metadata_specification.md)
* [IHEC Metadata Specification (version 2.0)](https://github.com/IHEC/ihec-ecosystems/blob/master/docs/metadata/2.0/Ihec_metadata_specification.md)

For all new submissions we highly recommened to comply with the most recent specification.


### Reference Builds and Gene Annotations

Documentation on adopted standards is [available here](http://www.epigenomes.ca/data/CEMT/resources/index.html).


### Minimum required track types

A description of the public access (processed) data files that should be provided by each group is [available here](./docs/minimum_required_track_types.md).


## IHEC Data Hubs

IHEC Data Hub are the documents that IHEC members produce to exchange metadata. These JSON-formatted documents are mostly used to submit data to the IHEC Data Portal. The JSON Schema, a validator and a converter to UCSC Genome Browser track hub documents are [available here](./IHEC_Data_Hub).

## Metadata Validation and Versioning

For metadata versioning/validation submodule, see [available here](./version_metadata).
