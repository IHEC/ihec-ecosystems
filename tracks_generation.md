# Track generation standards

The purpose of this document is to define the way mandatory tracks should be generated, in an attempt to make inter-consortia tracks at least a bit more comparable.


### RNA-Seq

* Signal track (unstranded): TODO
* Signal track (forward): TODO
* Signal track (reverse): TODO
* RPKM: See proposal [here](https://github.com/IHEC/ihec-assay-standards/blob/master/RNA_Seq_normalization.md).


### Bisulfite-Seq

* See proposal [here](./Fractional_Methylation_Proposal.md).


### ChIP-Seq

* Signal: TODO
* Peak Calls: TODO
